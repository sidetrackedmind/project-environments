# project-environments
This is a repository to store requirements.txt and Dockerfiles.

## Instructions
1. clone the repo
2. navigate to the cloned repo
3. `docker build -t geoimg:v1 .`

*note - as I update this repo, I'm hoping to have multiple Dockerfiles and requirements.txt files for specific projects. The Dockerfile in the repo is for geospatial data packages, originally created by Geoff Boeing
